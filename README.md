Introduction

The goal of this project is to segment mall customers into distinct groups by examining their spending scores and income. 
This segmentation enables the implementation of targeted marketing strategies, ensuring that each group receives personalized and relevant marketing efforts.

To segment customers I am using an unsupervised machine learning technique called K-means clustering for the following reasons -
- K-means algorithm can efficiently identify distinct groups within the two-dimensional space. 
- The results of k-means are easy to interpret, as customers are grouped into clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids, allowing for straightforward visualization and understanding.
- Additionally, K-means is well-suited for continuous data, such as income and spending scores, where distance measures like Euclidean distance can be effectively used to define similarity.

Data Preparation 

I am extracting spending score and annual income features from the data for the purpose of clustering as it will help identify distinct customer groups based on their spending potential. 
Identifying such groups will provide actionable insights into customer behavior, allowing the mall to tailor marketing strategies, promotions, and offerings to specific customer segments.
