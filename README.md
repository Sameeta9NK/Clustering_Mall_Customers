Introduction

The goal of this project is to segment mall customers into distinct groups by examining their spending scores and income. 
This segmentation enables the implementation of targeted marketing strategies, ensuring that each group receives personalized and relevant marketing efforts.

K-means Clustering

- K-means method for clustering as the algorithm can efficiently identify distinct groups within the two-dimensional space. 
- The results of k-means are easy to interpret, as customers are grouped into clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids, allowing for straightforward visualization and understanding.
- Additionally, K-means is well-suited for continuous data, such as income and spending scores, where distance measures like Euclidean distance can be effectively used to define similarity.
